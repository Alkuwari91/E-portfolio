    <h2>Unit 1: Introduction to Machine Learning (ML)</h2>
    <p>Welcome to Week 1.</p>
    
    <p>Machine learning (ML) has become a cornerstone of modern technology, shaping our daily experiences—from internet browsing to banking decisions. The availability of big data in real-time enhances the ability of ML algorithms to make autonomous and accurate decisions (Schwab & Zahid 2020). This week, we will explore the history, current developments, and future possibilities of ML, along with the challenges and opportunities in utilizing algorithms for decision-making and profiling.</p>
    
    <p>We will also examine the interplay among big data analytics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, with a focus on how these technologies shape future industries.</p>

    <h3>This week you will learn about:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The past, present, and future of machine learning.</li>
        <li>Challenges and opportunities in using ML algorithms.</li>
        <li>The relationship between big data, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>On completion of this week, you will be able to:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Gain a deeper understanding of ML's role in future industries.</li>
        <li>Identify key skill sets needed for proficiency in ML.</li>
        <li>Recognize common pitfalls in machine learning and ways to mitigate them.</li>
