					<h2>Unit 1: Introduction to Machine Learning (ML)</h2>
					<p>Welcome to Week 1 of the Machine Learning Course! In this unit, we will explore the fundamental concepts of machine learning (ML), an area of artificial intelligence (AI) that empowers systems to learn from data and make decisions with minimal human intervention.</p>

					<p>Machine learning has become a transformative technology in many industries, from healthcare to finance, enabling personalized recommendations, predictive analytics, and autonomous systems. From browsing the internet to approving loans, machine learning is at the core of many decision-making processes. It allows machines to analyze vast amounts of data, recognize patterns, and make decisions faster than any human could (Schwab & Zahid 2020).</p>

					<h3>What is Machine Learning?</h3>
					<p>At its core, machine learning is the study of algorithms that enable computers to perform tasks without explicit instructions. These algorithms are trained on data and can automatically improve their performance over time. The goal is for the machine to learn patterns from the data, allowing it to make accurate predictions or decisions based on new, unseen information.</p>

					<h3>Key Machine Learning Types:</h3>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Supervised Learning:</strong> In supervised learning, the algorithm learns from labeled data. It is given a set of inputs along with the correct outputs, and the goal is to learn a mapping function that can predict outputs from new inputs. Examples include classification (e.g., spam detection in emails) and regression (e.g., predicting house prices).</li>
						<li><strong>Unsupervised Learning:</strong> In unsupervised learning, the algorithm works with unlabeled data. It tries to find patterns, clusters, or structures within the data. Clustering (e.g., customer segmentation) and association (e.g., market basket analysis) are common examples.</li>
						<li><strong>Reinforcement Learning:</strong> This type of learning involves an agent that interacts with an environment and learns to make decisions by receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties. Over time, the agent aims to maximize its cumulative reward (e.g., teaching a robot to walk or play a game).</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>This week, you will learn about:</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>The history and evolution of machine learning, from early rule-based systems to modern deep learning.</li>
						<li>Real-world applications of machine learning across different industries.</li>
						<li>The ethical considerations and challenges of using machine learning algorithms, such as data privacy and algorithmic bias.</li>
						<li>Introduction to key machine learning frameworks and tools, such as Python’s Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow.</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>Why is Machine Learning Important?</h3>
					<p>Machine learning is a cornerstone of innovation in the modern world. It enables businesses to leverage their data more effectively, leading to insights that can improve decision-making, efficiency, and customer satisfaction. Furthermore, machine learning technologies are driving advancements in areas like autonomous vehicles, natural language processing, and personalized healthcare.</p>
