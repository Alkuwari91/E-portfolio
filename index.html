        <h2>Unit 1: Introduction to Machine Learning (ML)</h2>
        <p>Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. This unit covers the basic concepts of ML, including supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning, and introduces key algorithms like decision trees and support vector machines.</p>

Welcome to Week 1.

Machine learning has become an integral part of our daily life. From browsing on internet through to getting a bank loan, machine learning (ML) is used to make decisions and for profiling. The availability of big data on a real-time basis facilitates the learning of the ML algorithms, which in turn provides machines with the ability to make more accurate decisions autonomously (Schwab & Zahid 2020).

This week we shall learn about:
The past, present and future of machine learning.
The challenges and opportunities of using algorithms.
Interplay among big data analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence.
On completion of this week, you will be able to:
Have a better understanding of the of role machine learning in future industry.
Identify skill sets required to become proficient in machine learning.
Know about the pitfalls of machine learning and ways to address it.

Introductory Session and the Team Project. There will be a discussion/ briefing on the assessments for this module. As it involves a team project, you will need to read the Group/Teamwork guidance on the Department website regarding team roles and the scoring of team activities.

Teams will be assigned and there is a deadline at the end of this week for the final group contract to be agreed by each team. A copy will need to be emailed to the module tutor. If you cannot attend this session, please get in touch with the module tutor as soon as possible.
e-Portfolio. The e-portfolio is one of the final assessment pieces for this module. If you haven’t already done so, you will need to create a new section in your e-portfolio specifically for this module. A guideline on the requirements is provided on the "e-Portfolio" page. If you have any questions about this, please contact the module tutor. This week take part in the collaborative discussion.

Module Wiki. As you work through this module, you will inevitably come across terms and pieces of information which are novel and worth sharing. You can place such information in the Module Wiki to benefit the whole group. In the wiki, you can place a term/word/phrase, as well as its definition and/or any information you have sourced on the topic (clearly referenced).

Prepare for next week’s seminar by reviewing the preparation material available in Unit 2.

Google Colab is a very useful resource when it comes to machine learning. This browser tool enables you to work with TensorFlow, as well as develop and train neural networks. Take some time to familiarise yourself with the tool and attempt the various tutorials.
